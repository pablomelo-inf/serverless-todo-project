# Serverless TODO


# Functionality of the application

This application will allow creating/removing/updating/fetching TODO items. 

Each TODO item can optionally have an attachment image.

Each user only has access to TODO items that he/she has created.





# TODO items

The application should store TODO items, and each TODO item contains the following fields:

* `todoId` (string) - a unique id for an item
* `createdAt` (string) - date and time when an item was created
* `name` (string) - name of a TODO item (e.g. "Change a light bulb")
* `dueDate` (string) - date and time by which an item should be completed
* `done` (boolean) - true if an item was completed, false otherwise
* `attachmentUrl` (string) (optional) - a URL pointing to an image attached to a TODO item


   
# Functions


* `GetTodos` - should return all TODOs for a current user. A user id can be extracted from a JWT token that is sent by the frontend

It should return data that looks like this:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "todoId": "123",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Buy milk",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": false,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
    {
      "todoId": "456",
      "createdAt": "2019-07-27T20:01:45.424Z",
      "name": "Send a letter",
      "dueDate": "2019-07-29T20:01:45.424Z",
      "done": true,
      "attachmentUrl": "http://example.com/image.png"
    },
  ]
}
```

* `CreateTodo` - should create a new TODO for a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `CreateTodoRequest.ts` file.

* `UpdateTodo` - should update a TODO item created by a current user. A shape of data send by a client application to this function can be found in the `UpdateTodoRequest.ts` file.

* `DeleteTodo` - should delete a TODO item created by a current user. Expects an id of a TODO item to remove.

* `GenerateUploadUrl` - returns a pre-signed URL that can be used to upload an attachment file for a TODO item.

It should return a JSON object that looks like this:

```json
{
  "uploadUrl": "https://s3-bucket-name.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/image.png"
}
```

All functions are already connected to appropriate events from API Gateway.

# Frontend

The `client` folder contains a web application that can use the API that should be developed in the project.


# How to run the application

## Backend

To deploy an application run the following commands:

```
cd backend
npm install
sls deploy -v
```

## Frontend

To run a client application first edit the `client/src/config.ts` file to set correct parameters. And then run the following commands:

```
cd client
npm install
npm run start
```

This should start a development server with the React application that will interact with the serverless TODO application.
